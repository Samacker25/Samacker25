#👋 Hi, I'm Soumen | Aspiring ML Engineer / MLOps Engineer

I’m an MCA graduate with 4+ years of Healthcare IT experience, now focused on building skills in Data Science, Machine Learning, and MLOps.
I enjoy creating production-grade ML pipelines, automating workflows, and deploying scalable models on the cloud.

I believe in learning by building — and most of my projects reflect real-world ML engineering and MLOps practices.

#🚀 What I Do

Build end-to-end ML pipelines with data ingestion → preprocessing → training → tracking → deployment

Create MLOps workflows using Docker, GitHub Actions, MLflow & DVC

Deploy ML services on AWS (EC2, ECR, EKS)

Apply engineering best practices: OOP, modular code, logging, config management, exception handling

Explore NLP, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision through hands-on projects
